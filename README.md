# About

A basic usecase for egui + binance-rs

An attempt to build realtime Stock & Derrivatives Terminal

## In Future:

- Add Axum or AWS Lambda for auth (preferrably use some federated auth through AWS Cognito)
- Alternate binance-rs with reqwest & tokio_stram for realtime data (to prevent vendor lock to binance)
- Embed egui as wasm - so no installation is requried
- Chart tools & indicators (MA,RSI, Bollinger Bands, Trends)
- Candlestick formation indicators
- Add tables for options trading and options strategy analysis (such as Iron Condors, Butterflies, Collars etc)
- implement polynomial, linear regression analysis (more onto quantitative trading statistical analysis)
